      <!-- About Text -->
      <div class="text-base leading-relaxed space-y-5">
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Supreme Trading Co.</span> was founded with
          a clear and powerful vision, to be
          <span class="italic">supreme</span> in everything we do. From day one,
          our aim has been to stand out not just through our products, but also through
          our service, values, and long-term customer relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based in <span class="font-medium">Bahadurgarh</span>, we are a
          trusted wholesale supplier of
          <span class="font-medium">raw materials for shoe manufacturing</span>.
          Our product range includes adhesives, threads, tapes, tools,
          foam, accessories, and much more, offering everything a footwear maker needs
          under one roof.
        </p>

        <p>
          With over 20 years of hands-on experience, our founder continues to
          lead the business with the same passion and commitment it began with.
          His focus on quality, timely delivery, and building trust has helped
          us earn the confidence of customers across the region.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <span class="font-semibold">Supreme Trading Co.</span>, we
          believe being <span class="italic">supreme</span> is not just a name. It is
          a responsibility we carry every day.
